# Computational Foundations of Neuroscience | Fall 2023
This repository is meant to be a place to share code and other resources for the course. It is not meant to be a place
to share solutions to homework problems.

Because the course is taught in MATLAB, the code here reflects my best attempts to translate the notebooks provided from 
MATLAB to Python. Please clone this repo and submit pull requests if you find any errors or have any suggestions for
improvement.
